# Hi, I'm Jonas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer/programmer/coder/engineer (whatever is the definition these days) working from Portugal.

Having suffered through my share of Friday deployments, coding in production, and manual testing, I have become obsessed with automating things, so I can sleep well at night.
